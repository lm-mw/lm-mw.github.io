<H3><u> Summary </u></H3>
<p>Since graduating from Ohio University in 2013 with a BBA focused in Management of Information Systems and Business Economics I have worked with organizations to understand their business practices and build cost-efficient, technology driven solutions that help them achieve their goals.  Though technological advances continue to open up new doors for improvement, the applications we interact with are only a portion of what goes into building and maintaining a successful organization in today's world.  In order to thrive, all components of an information system - People, Processes and Technology - must be in harmony with one another.  Using my skillset and years of hands-on project experience in multiple industries I can help your organization, large or small, achieve that harmony.</P>
