The past year has certainly been one for the history books.  Like many of you, I have taken steps to help make each day memorable and break up the monotony that is "quarantine". While I would be lying if I said that all of my free time has been spent on productive tasks, I hope that this site can serve as proof that not all of my time was wasted away!

Over time you'll see some more posts from me here on various (and often unrelated) topics. I'll also link some of my pet projects to the "Projects" page, and I hope you find great value in my no-cost, easy to use applications.

Stay tuned...
