"I'm glad you've taken the time to visit my website. If you don't know by now,
my name is Logan Morrow-Wright. I live in a wonderful town in Colorado with
my wife and our many cats and dogs, and I greatly enjoy the outdoor recreation
that this beautiful state has to offer. Whether you are browsing this site as
a potential employer, family member, long time friend or complete stranger,
I hope you find the content interesting and useful.

-Logan"
